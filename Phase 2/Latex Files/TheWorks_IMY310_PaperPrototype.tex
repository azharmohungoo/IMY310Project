\section{Motivations for Alternative Designs}

\section{Testing the Designs}
	When testing, we presented our paper based designs to the stakeholders in a sequential order starting from the home page. We proceeded to each of the options within the menu of the home page, while providing them with explanations on how the product functions moving from one web page to the other. The stakeholders then provided us with comments about the sketches, which in turn helps us determine what they expect and what changes they would like to make for the product.

\section{Feedback Received}
	The design of our paer based prototypes was shown to va saple of our stakeholders so their input could be used to generate a product design to meet their requirements.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\bullet$] A few were concerned about the lack of colours in the paper prototypes.
		\item[$\bullet$] The layout of the main page was mostly mentioned as an impressive part of the design
		\item[$\bullet$] Functionality was said to be clearly visible in terms of the required information to be given to a function
		\item[$\bullet$] Alternative design of the pages where favored a bit more due to the layout having less options
		\item[$\bullet$] The floating menu bar is out of place on some pages
		\item[$\bullet$]  Some of the functionality requires for a lot of fields to be dfilled
	\end{itemize}
\section{Using the Feedback}
	The user feedback is an important tool in the design phase when maiking a product. This is how we plan on using it to better satisfy the requirements set by ourstakeholders
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\bullet$] Keep the labeling on the pages short and using more icons so functionality can be understood without having to read	
		\item[$\bullet$] Reduce the functionality to require more clicking of s button than the filling of forms
		\item[$\bullet$] Changing the menubar to better suit the layout
	\end{itemize}
