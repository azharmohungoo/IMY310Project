\section{Needs Identification}

There are farmers that are in need of farming equipment that can be quite expensive. Some farmers do not know of places where to acquire equipment while other farmers have equipment that is no longer useful to them for various reasons. Rather than searching of equipment at many different places, AgriSales aims to create a market for farmers to buy and sell the equipment. They also issue a magazine where new and old products alike are advertised.
\\ \\
The folowing are just some of the identified problems with the website:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Login Form pops up and over other items on the page and doesn’t pop away.
	\item The website does not accommodate screens of different sizes, the design does not accommodate different devices.
	\item Advertisments flash and change which draws the users attention away from them.
	\item Menu has a missing options after you have logged in as an registered user.
	\item Some of the buttons have labels that are vague in their description, and you don’t intrusively know what pressing them will lead to.
	\item When you're trying to sell equipment the forms have missing inputs boxes.
	\item Sidebar menu just dissappears when you click on the profile link.
	\item A very useless attempt at animation in the form of a tractor on the home page.
	\item Back button is not part of the footer, just strangely placed at the top of the page.
\end{itemize}

\section{User Identification}

The user base are people that are invested in the agriculture and construction industry. It is aimed at people that are looking to buy or sell construction and commercial vehicles. A subscription allows users that want to observe the market in order to stay up to date on the latest products and the current price ranges.
\\ \\
Our user groups include the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Buyers: Users who are looking to buy machinery.
	\item Sellers: Users who are looking to sell their used machinery.
	\item Browers: Users who look through the equipment that is on sale which they can potentially buy.
\end{itemize}


\section{User Needs}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Buyers need to be able to search for a product which is on sale and whom are willing to buy.
	\item Sellers should be able to upload their products on either the website or the magazine or both.
	\item Sellers should be able to register onto the website in order to be able to sell their products.
	\item All users should be able to subscribe and receive new installments of the magazine.
\end{itemize}
